# Design-Patterns---java 

## About

You can pull the entire project to retrieve every patterns examples, or simply check in the pattern folder. 

**Every pattern's main class (containing the main method) use this format : #name#Pattern (e.g factoryPattern)**

More pattern examples are still under development :)

## What's already done ?

### Creational

- **Factory design pattern** : 
  - Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create
  - *Illustrated by a RTS units creation system*
- **Singleton design pattern** : 
  - Restricts object creation for a class to only one instance
  - Using 3 different approaches (unsafe for threading, safe for threading and safe for threading using synchronized)

### Structural

- **Decorator pattern** : 
  - Dynamically adds/overrides behaviour in an existing method of an object
  - Illustrated by a dessert + ingredient name and price printing
