In object-oriented programming, the [decorator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, **without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class**. 

The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) , as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern.
